 
 Present data:
 - include a summary on page of the number of changes to published bands if that ci used
- display the calculated school sd somewhere on the page along with the pupil sd
- add a 'generate' url function to pass details on to someone else
- add the name of the school vertically on the plots
- sankey showing movement of schools between bands based on methods/p-values

df per year
match based on URN and show all the results in one go
panel at the top will be tabbed with:
- selected schools (and either individual remove buttons , or clear)
- all results for selected schools (including attainment) for all available years
- all progress charts in h-scrollable panel
- all national comparison charts in h-scrollable panel

Would need matching, but for now
- aggregate display columns and present in one table with all subjects
- list selected schools in different tab
- list aggregate details in different tab
- new methodology will go in separate tab
- p-value selection will be a dropdown within the tab


- can create the summary charts/ tables outside of shiny processing


 





One issue I've been getting is that because we're approximating CIs, in some cases schools can go from average to extreme above/below (and vice versa) just because of rounding.
This is because the CIs are estimated from rounded progress values and estimated cohort size. If the upper/lower CI is very close to zero, it can go one way or the other very easily. We're more likely to see this with smaller schools.
Also, cutoffs aren't necessarily at exact 10% value.



Consider publishing:
unrounded progress scores
number of pupils contributing to progress score





There is a noticeable lack of schools between 10 and 30 cohort size in "above" and "below" average (they are either in average, or well above/below average)
similar effect (in fact barely noticeably different) when changing ci to 80%
